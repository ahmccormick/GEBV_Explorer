# ðŸ§¬ GEBV Explorer
# An app to interactively filter and visualize genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs)



#First Steps to download and run GEBV Explorer
1) Clone the repo with the below command in terminal
    "git clone https://github.com/ahmccormick/GEBV_Explorer.git"
2) cd GEBV_Explorer

3) Create a new environment (Environment_1) and activate (made using python 3.12.10)

   python3 -m venv Environment_1
   source Environment_1/bin/activate 

4) Install dependencies with the below 
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5) Launch the app
   streamlit run GEBV_app_6.py

6) Exit from the environment by typing "deactivate" in terminal

#Data 

#App contains the GEBV data for 13 agronomic traits and 16 quality traits for the Capsicum core collection (n=423)
#16 quality trait data located in: data/GEBV_quality_core_16traits_n423.csv
#13 agronomic traits (averaged over three experimental timepoints) located in: data/GEBVs_core_13_agronomic_traits_avg.csv


#Usage

#Adjust sliders on the left to filter lines for any GEBV trait or combinations of traits
#The filtered table will update in real time.
#Explore any two-trait combinations in the scatterplot (default: Yield vs. Brix)
#Red points in the scatterplot highlight the lines that meet all of your threshold criteria
#Download filtered lines as a CSV.
