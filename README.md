 ðŸ§¬ GEBV Explorer
 An app to interactively filter and visualize genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs)



First Steps to download and run GEBV Explorer
1) Clone the repo with the below command in terminal
    git clone https://github.com/ahmccormick/GEBV_Explorer.git
2) cd GEBV_Explorer

3) Install dependencies with the below (made using python 3.12.10)
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4) Launch the app
   streamlit run GEBV_app_6.py



Data 

App contains the GEBV data for 13 agronomic traits and 16 quality traits for the Capsicum core collection (n=423)
16 quality trait data located in: data/GEBV_quality_core_16traits_n423.csv
13 agronomic traits (averaged over three experimental timepoints) located in: data/GEBVs_core_13_agronomic_traits_avg.csv


Usage

Adjust sliders on the left to filter lines for any GEBV trait or combinations of traits
The filtered table will update in real time.
Explore any two-trait combinations in the scatterplot (default: Yield vs. Brix)
Red points in the scatterplot highlight the lines that meet all of your threshold criteria
Download filtered lines as a CSV.
